    <h2>UPL – Supply Chain & Manufacturing Operations Co-Op</h2>
    <p><strong>Jan 2024 – Aug 2025 | Cary, NC | On-site | 3 Rotations</strong></p>
      <div class="highlight">
    <h3>Overall Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Across three rotations at UPL, I advanced from learning the fundamentals of distribution network design 
      to helping deliver high-impact projects in data accuracy, standardization, and national logistics strategy. 
      I created dashboards that improved executive visibility, standardized SAP specifications to ensure 
      reliable manufacturing data, and built a custom Streamlit app to automate Excel file comparisons for 
      tracking imports in real time. My final rotation focused on strategic warehouse network design, 
      where I modeled a nine-facility U.S. system, developed simulation tools, and launched dashboards that 
      reduced stranded inventory and improved service levels. Together, these experiences strengthened my 
      technical skills in Python, SAP, and data visualization, while also proving my ability to translate 
      complex data into actionable supply chain improvements.
    </p>
  </div>
    <h2>Rotation 1 – Distribution Network Foundations (Spring 2024)</h2>
    <p>• Entered the co-op by studying UPL’s North American distribution system, identifying inefficiencies in warehouse placement and product movement.</p>
    <p>• Designed and presented four dashboards visualizing warehouse KPIs and service-level performance, which became a key tool for network decision-making.</p>
    <p>• Learned how to use SAP ERP, Excel, and Python to build data pipelines that connected raw system data with visual insights.</p>

    <h2>Rotation 2 – Data Accuracy & Standardization (Spring–Summer 2025)</h2>
    <p>• BOM Loss Project: Audited 892 SKUs, corrected Bills of Materials, and standardized component loss percentages, reducing future misstatements in cost and inventory planning.</p>
    <p>• Finishing Specifications: Updated 128 private-label finishing specs, corrected SAP naming errors for 122 SKUs, and created 118 new specifications—bringing uniformity and accuracy across private-label production.</p>
    <p>• Built a Streamlit app that compares two Excel files and highlights changes. This solved a real issue for UPL, where tracking import files manually made it difficult to identify shifting POD dates, customs changes, or added delays.</p>

    <h2>Rotation 3 – National Warehousing & Distribution Strategy (Summer 2024 – Summer 2025)</h2>
    <p>• Modeled warehouse network options and finalized a 9-facility national design covering U.S. demand within 1–2 days.</p>
    <p>• Developed Python-based simulation tools that tested SKU placement, inventory alignment, and import strategies against historical and forecasted sales data.</p>
    <p>• Built real-time inventory dashboards to spot stranded stock and prevent stock-outs.</p>
    <p>• Created a seasonality dashboard to visualize SKU-level demand cycles and improve time-sensitive distribution decisions.</p>
    <p>• Demonstrated measurable value by reducing stranded inventory risk, improving service levels, and enabling proactive, data-driven distribution planning.</p>

      <h3>Capstone Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        By the end of my co-op, I wasn’t just supporting projects—I was designing and automating tools that UPL could continue using to refine their supply chain strategies long after I left. My journey at UPL was one of learning how to take raw, messy data and transform it into insights, tools, and decisions that tangibly improved operations.
