    <h1>Hi, I'm Suyash Sapre</h1>
    <p>Industrial & Systems Engineering @ NC State | Class of 2026</p>
    <p>I started in Mechanical Engineering but moved to ISE for its breadth — I'm especially interested in supply chain analytics, business intelligence, and the power of data. I believe efficiency is everything — in work and life.</p>
